<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Well, to begin with- for a global pandemic, there's been a whole lot of travelling in football. And none of it insignificant. Whether it be Chelsea buying quality youth, or Barca acquiring experienced midfielders, the transfer market has been bursting.</p>

<br><div>

<img src = "articles/article46.jpg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></div><br>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The Engine Swap between the Blaugrana and the Bianconeri- This is probably the most headline-maker of a deal you can come across. Barca and Juve finalized a swap between them for 23- year-old Arthur and 30-year old Miralem Pjanic. Pjanic has been transferred to Barca for a reported deal of 60 million Euros. Whereas Juventus has reportedly paid around 12 million more for the Brazilian Arthur Melo. Now, the favour for this deal has been broken on the Cules' side. To Blaugrana fans, Arthur Melo was a young Xavi burning with potential. Now that he's sold (and that too, to Juventus) , the disadvantages of it will be exaggerated, and the benefits of having Pjanic on the team- ignored. Though this deal may not have our total support, it might just be a mutually beneficial deal which could see Barca play with a technically skilled midfielder, and Juventus have a raw, talented and composed CM/CDM on their team.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Dandy Deliveries at the Stamford Bridge- There are many reasons to praise Frank Lampard's Chelsea- the way they've played this season, the way they've groomed youth players like Hudson-Odoi, Mason Mount, Pulisic and Billy Gilmour; and last but not least- their transfers. Now, Chelsea has got two of the players with strikingly top-class potential- Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech. Starting with Timo Werner, a young, fast-paced, proficient German striker with deadly finishing, transferred from RB Leipzig to Chelsea. At 48 million Euros, this deal might just be a steal. The man is getting paid 200,000 Euros. What a transfer. This will add marginally to Chelsea's already young and fast attack. Deadly. In addition, Hakim Ziyech, a 27-year-old Moroccan national CAM, with skilled footwork and someone who can deliver long balls/crosses effortlessly. Trust me, you would want him on your team. The deal is around 40 million Euros, and might potentially rise to 44 million. Whatever it is, Chelsea's checking all the boxes. Except having a tolerable home kit- and winning against West Ham, that is.</p>
		            			
<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Leroy sets foot in Munich- This hot deal has been a heated rumour for a year or so, but not anymore. Leroy Sane, the young German winger who has sufficiently contributed to Man City's Premier League success has signed a deal with Bayern Munich. Sane suffered the first major injury of his career when he broke his anterior cruciate ligament in a Community Shield game against Liverpool in the August of 2019, which sparked a series of events that ultimately resulted in his transfer this week. Bayern has paid a reported fee of 49 million Euros, which I have to say- is simply shrewd by Bayern. The winger is at least valued around 80 million, and Bayern stole him for 50. Shrewd. Pep Guardiola, former Barca manager and currently the manager for City, said that he didn't want Sane to leave, but the German winger wanted a move to Bundesliga. This might make the Bayern attack more starstruck than it already is. Gnabry on the right, my man Lewandoski in the centre and now, Sane on the left. Pace, power, skill, finishing- you name it. For City, well. They've lost Kompany, Silva and now, Sane. They didn't manage to replace Kompany successfully, and now need to strengthen their defence as well. To add to that, yes, Mahrez can play on the left. But he's just not enough. Gabriel Jesus can, too. However, he's a striker, and the wing needs to be solid with players sticking to their position. Same with Bernardo Silva, hell of a player- but his standards have not been the same since last season. In short, City needs to get its act in order. They need to rebuild half of their team, and find a solid lineup like the last 2 of their spectacular seasons.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">This it for now, folks. Football is so dynamic, I swear. Pedro is leaving Chelsea and now off to Roma. It's tough to take your eyes off the telly when Leroy is suddenly playing for Bayern, and Pedro for Roma. </p>
