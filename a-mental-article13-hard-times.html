<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">As we all know, the world is grappling with an invisible, deadly enemy, and all of us are trying to adjust ourselves to our surroundings. However it is quite difficult for us humans to be confined to our homes since we are social beings, and we need communication with the outside world to keep us sane. </p>

<br><div>

<img src = "articles/article13.jpg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></div><br>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The coronavirus has transformed life as we know it. All schools, restaurants, airports, malls, are shut and the future seems very uncertain. It is almost as if our life has been put to a stop. But, as much as we hate being locked up in our homes, we have no other alternative as such. So we have to keep ourselves busy with different activities that will entertain us.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">I don't know about you all, but some of my friends and I have been feeling lonely, being left to ourselves with our thoughts. These very thoughts are giving birth to anxiety and a slight touch of depression. We have way too much time to ourselves, which is causing us to overthink, and at times, break down, without any justifiable reason.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">All I am saying is if you are facing this too, it's normal and you're not the only one. All of us have been suddenly exposed to a lifestyle which none of us are accustomed to. Staying locked inside our homes, away from our friends, relatives, having online classes, etc. are all very difficult. But we are all in this together.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Majority of teenagers are finding it extremely hard to stay at home with their parents, siblings and grandchildren 24/7, and very often they find themselves building arguments on the smallest of issues, which can be quite exhausting not only for them but also for the family members. We have to learn to make our peace with them because at the end of the day, they are the ones who love us the most, and the ones who we can't live without. I know it's easier said than done, but when you see that there is too much work on your parents' plate, be it sanitizing things, or be it washing the dishes and even ironing the clothes, you can step up to help them with it. This not only makes your parents happy but also makes them feel loved by their children. And, I guess that's all we need, love, to get us through these tough times. This will help you maintain a healthy relationship with your parents. As far as siblings are concerned try avoiding fights or arguments on petty issues- such as fighting over a remote, or who sleeps on which side of the bed, etc. Basically, instead of being irritated by them or irritating them, try to get closer to them, watch movies, enjoy yourselves, play board games and many other things. This will not only help you make peace with them but also help you and your siblings create a special bond.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">I know that in today's world, especially now that we have so much time in our hands, it is hard to take time off your phones, laptops or iPads, but trust me, social media being social media, will always find some medium or the other to exhaust you. I'm not saying give up on social media. NOT AT ALL. But try and find time for yourself. Try to find out your likes and dislikes, try to find your passion and your hobbies. If you like drawing and artsy stuff, think of something innovative, try and make art that makes you feel good. If you like music, try making songs. This will not only fetch you appraisal, but it will also help you in making yourself happy.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">All I'm trying to say is that I know these are hard times. But we can find our own way to make ourselves happy during this pandemic by finding happiness; not in the huge, extravagant life outside, but in the small things and gestures in our very own house.</p>
