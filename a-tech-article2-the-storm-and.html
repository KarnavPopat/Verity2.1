<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The eastern side of India especially the state of Odisha, has been affected by Cyclones/Storms almost every year, but Cyclone Amphan, which hit the state of West Bengal as well caused a lot of damage to the citizens as well as the infrastructure of the state.</p>

<img src = "articles/article2.jpg" alt = "image" class ="img-fluid"></div><br>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">The cyclone has caused a lot of sufferance in the lives of many people because of the disruptions in cellular and internet conectivity. With cables getting stuck under fallen trees to internet poles getting ripped off of the ground and power transformers being disrupted, human life has been hampered a lot with businesses and schools being affected the most. The cyclone made landfall on the night of May 20th, and large parts of West Bengal lost electricity and internet connectivity along with being submerged underwater. Most places in the city of Kolkata got back electricity by midnight, but some places didn't get until a few days later, and some telecom operators were unable to restore their cell services until the next few days in many cases.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">This disruption of broadband and cellular connectivity had accentuated the feeling of loneliness and isolation even more among certain people. With the lockdown restrictions still not having been lifted, many people have been using social media and apps like FaceTime, Skype, and Zoom to keep in touch with their friends and family, but this loss of internet and cellular service caused a lot of disturbance in the already disturbed lives, and the sights of destruction have caused bouts of depression in many.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Satellite and Cable television services were also suspended, and due to the loss of electricity, people had to sit in completely dark spaces, and in many cases, their houses were completely flooded because rainwater had somehow managed to enter, and since schools are closed as well, studying was a problem. It was a very eerie feeling having to sit inside without being able to contact anyone, while everything was being destroyed outside.</p>

<p class="articleparagraph" style="color: white;">Although now in many places across the city of Kolkata, broadband and cellular connectivity has been restored, in many of the affected rural places, cellular connections still haven't been restored and those people are disconnected from the world. Hopefully things will get better soon and people won't have to live in isolation.</p>
